    <h1 id="title">The adventures of Johnny and Strudel Boi</h1>
    <article>
        <p>		John was once again running late. He hadn't touched his homework over the weekend. Nor had he managed to
            brush his teeth, tie his shoes, or really do anything that would make him look like a presentable human.
            He was in essence a wreck and a shining example of what a failure in procrastination looked like. Despite
            his boasting about being a procrastinator he obviously had not mastered the art. Because getting his shit together was
            harder than he expected. </p>



        <p>	He pulled his book bag on his shoulders and made his way to the door. His mom called out to him
            <em>&quot;Did you eat yet?&quot;</em> John rolled his eyes. He stomped to the kitchen in protest. Grabbed a strudel from the box and
            replied. <em>&quot;Of course mom! I'm just taking it for the road! I love you, I'm going to miss the bus, bye!&quot;</em>
            He said it all in one breath and slammed the door behind him before he could hear his mothers retort.

        <p>	As he stepped on the porch he saw that the bus was already on his block. They  were both about equal distance from the stop.
            About a block. He prayed that Jim was already at the stop. If he was then he would be slow to move onto the bus as he would have most certainly
            convinced someone to play a Magic the Gathering battle with him. He always played the game until the bus had arrived and then
            would carefully put the cards up like the little treasures that they were to him. Much to the dismay and irritation o the bus driver.
            It would afford the opportunity for John to slip on the bus. As he ran to the stop he feverishly
            scanned the street corner for Jim.  When his eyes laid on Jim a sigh or relief spread over him. g
            He slowed down only to sprint again when he saw Jim standing up. He had made it across the street
            when he stepped on his shoe laces and went flying toward the ground. His chest hit with a hard thud
            knocking the air from his lungs. Everyone turned to look at him. <em>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</em> Jenny asked. She
            ran over to help him up. <em>&quot;I'm fine.&quot;</em> John retorted mostly ashamed. Not of what had transpired but because
            he knew it would be the topic of many discussions for the rest of the day.</p>
